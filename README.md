# Network_and_Web_Analysis

 Python programs I developed as part of a prior internship.

 1) Connectivity Checker: Provides real-time updates about the internet connection status and logs these updates in a text file. Will keep running in the background and informing the user accordingly.
 2) Metadata Extraction Tool: Code is designed to scrape a website for documents, download them and extract metadata from these documents, storing the metadata in separate text files based on the document types.
 3) Web scraper for emails: Scrapes through the linked pages of a given target website to extract email addresses and save unique addresses to an excel file.
 4) WiFi info retriever: Retrieves information about available Wi-Fi networks and notes it down on a text file.
 5) Status monitor: Requires both setup.py and Status_monitor.py.A command-line-interface(CLI) to continously monitor the connection status of a given list of websites, with the option to add/delete websites from the list.
